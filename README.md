## Description

Build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

- Defining variables with const and let
- Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
- Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
- Writing nested loops and using loop variables

## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Technologies

Begin the project with HTML and CSS to build the application.

Write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!
